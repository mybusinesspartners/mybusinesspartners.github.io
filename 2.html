Every small business is different, and businesses in different industries and sectors have different ways of going about getting credit. There are various costs which widely range over the span of particular sectors. However, for the core process of securing the financial assistance that a business owner needs for a start up, some basic guidelines and principles will help create effective programs and a solvent business model. Estimate the costs of doing business, find out what you need to borrow money, and then research your financing options. </p> <h2> <span> Steps</span> </h2> <h3> Part <span> 1</span> <span> of 3:</span> <span> Estimating Costs of Your Business</span> </h3> <span> {"smallUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/4\/4b\/Finance-a-Business-Step-1-Version-2.jpg\/v4-460px-Finance-a-Business-Step-1-Version-2.jpg","bigUrl":"\/images\/thumb\/4\/4b\/Finance-a-Business-Step-1-Version-2.jpg\/aid1179987-v4-728px-Finance-a-Business-Step-1-Version-2.jpg","smallWidth":460,"smallHeight":345,"bigWidth":"728","bigHeight":"546","licensing":" div class=\"mw-parser-output\" p License: a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/3.0\/\" Creative Commons \/a br \n \/p p br \/ \n \/p \/div "}</span> 1 <b> Determine the one-time costs of your business.</b> These are costs that will only occur at the very beginning of opening your business.

These include costs of utilities, insurance, wages, etc. Recurring costs are generally larger than one-time costs, and span a length of 10-30 years depending on your financing options. Calculate not only the total cost over the lifespan of your business, but also that on a yearly, and bi-yearly basis.

The cost of your utilities, or your administrative costs are all fixed. Variable costs are those which will change over time. This includes wages, insurance, and shipping/packaging costs. The best way to keep all this information organized is to create a spreadsheet (use Excel). That way you can graph out this information, and view it multiple ways(bar graph, line chart, etc.).

Find all of your financial statements and gather them together before you start to analyze.

They will provide you a sum of money, in exchange for part-ownership of your company. This is a good option because investors look further down the road than a loan company, and you will have more money on hand. However, the investors will naturally want to interfere, and change aspects of your business model.

You can also check out private equity firms, which contain a vast array of specialized and experienced investors. Remember, that small business owners generally use very little equity financing. It all depends on your business model, and the potential for growth.

"SAFE was coined by Y Combinator, and it's a very simple acronym that stands for 'simple agreement for future equity.' That document has different things that you can set, but essentially, you sell an agreement for the future stock."</p> <span> {"smallUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/2\/2e\/Finance-a-Business-Step-7.jpg\/v4-460px-Finance-a-Business-Step-7.jpg","bigUrl":"\/images\/thumb\/2\/2e\/Finance-a-Business-Step-7.jpg\/aid1179987-v4-728px-Finance-a-Business-Step-7.jpg","smallWidth":460,"smallHeight":345,"bigWidth":"728","bigHeight":"546","licensing":" div class=\"mw-parser-output\" p License: a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/3.0\/\" Creative Commons \/a br \n \/p p br \/ \n \/p \/div "}</span> 2 <b> Start your business using debt financing.</b> Debt financing is when you take out a loan, usually from a bank or lending institution. This is a great option because the bank will have no say in how you run your business. The loan is tax deductible, and you can get short-term or long-term loans. However, you must have the loan repaid in a certain amount of time, and if you don't, you could have a hard time getting capital investment. [10] <span> <span> X</span> <span> Research source</span> <span> </span> </span> Talk to your local bank, or lending institution about the qualifications for specific loans. You will probably have to fill out some paperwork to determine whether or not you are qualified. When using a local bank, you may be able to set up a personal relationship. This way, you can postpone a few payments if you fall on hard times. <span> {"smallUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/4\/49\/Finance-a-Business-Step-8.jpg\/v4-460px-Finance-a-Business-Step-8.jpg","bigUrl":"\/images\/thumb\/4\/49\/Finance-a-Business-Step-8.jpg\/aid1179987-v4-728px-Finance-a-Business-Step-8.jpg","smallWidth":460,"smallHeight":345,"bigWidth":"728","bigHeight":"546","licensing":" div class=\"mw-parser-output\" p License: a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/3.0\/\" Creative Commons \/a br \n \/p p br \/ \n \/p \/div "}</span> 3 <b> Find out about credit scores and ratings.</b> The higher your score is, the less risky you are to investors. In many cases, the initial business loan will be based on the borrower's own personal credit score. However, in some cases where a business is already operational, a business plan and other documents can provide for a different kind of credit specifically for the continued operations of that enterprise. Use the online company TransUnion or EquiFax to determine your credit score. It is important to get an independent analysis, otherwise your own calculated score could be biased. The main focus of the score is how long you have maintained a credit line, and how many monthly payments you have made on time. If you have no prior experience taking out credit, it may be hard to get a loan. It is best to start using a credit card on small things like gas, or grocery store trips. Then gradually build up. Show the creditors you are a responsible client.

Equity simply means any retained earnings and cash injections by investors. In order to start out with equity, the owner of the business usually has to put in anywhere from 20-40%. This will maintain an adequate debt to equity ratio, and allow you to get a loan.

This means you risk some of the items you own. In the case you cannot repay the loan, the bank can seize your property. Collateral usually includes homes, cars, furniture, equipment, stocks, bonds, etc. this is a scary proposition, so you need to be sure that your business will be financially successful beforehand.

Talk to various lenders and ask them about what kinds of loans are available. Evaluate loans by timeline. Lenders will offer various short-term, long-term or revolving-credit loans to business owners. Look at which ones suit the needs of a startup the best. [14] <span> <span> X</span> Trustworthy Source <span> US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</span> <span> U.S. government agency for protecting consumers in the financial sector</span> Go to source </span> Look at secured and unsecured business loans. Secured loans actually use existing assets as collateral. For example, the person trying to start a business can use his or her home, or other property, as collateral and get lower interest rates for the loan. However, this leaves the assets vulnerable to seizure in cases of nonpayment. Unsecured loans rest solely on the borrower's credit score. See which of these types of loans best matches desired risk. Select the best deals. You want a loan that has the lowest interest rates and most favorable terms for repayment.

However, large investment banks such as JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America have received a set of moneys from the Federal Reserve to lend out to small businesses. This is your best option to go with, although it takes the long to pay off. Local banks will set you up with a contract, and a monthly payment. The other benefit is that you can get this loan postponed if you are having trouble paying it off.

This is a gamble because they, and you, are betting that you will be able to earn enough in the future. There is usually a contract involved, guaranteeing that they will at least get some money back, so keep that in mind.

The downside of this is that it could take months or years before you raise enough money.

Be passionate about your idea when you present, and know all of the financial details before you walk in the room. Keep in contact with the investor days and weeks after your initial meeting.
